#### Notes
Five techniques
1. Pen down every thought
  - Don't leave a single thought
  - Every thought tells something which is deep subconsciously in your brain
  - Suprise: in the written down sentences lies a solution
    - Make an actionplan
    - Act on it
  - In case it's all thought of past
    - burn the page and let it go
2. Listen to soft music / music that suits you
  - that helps your brain to calm down
3. Take cold or lukewarm shower or lukewarm footbath
  - Just thinking/chattering your brain and not finding a solution/way out there is no point
  - Relaxes your brain
4. Play with your pet, go closer to nature, touch plants/leaves
5. Expose yourself to sun
5. Ayurveda: Overweight? Exercise!
  - Pranayama / Breathing Exercise / Inner Healing
  - Yoga
  - Some kind of exercise
