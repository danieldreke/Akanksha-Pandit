### What is Karma? @7:04
- Karma means action, Karma is everything you are doing with your thoughts, with your words and with your hands.
- Quote from Bhagavad Gita: Just do Karma, don't expect what return you will get.

### Do we get result now or in next birth? @8:04
- Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.
- So whatever you are doing the return is going to come for sure.
- If you are doing a positive action the positive return is going to come.
- If you do a negative action a negative return is going to come.
- It's not that if like you do it now and you immediately get it in return, no, the return is going to come for sure.
- Charity is when it gives sense of bliss to your inner heart, like when you give and you feeling bliss in your inner heart that is real charity. So that is karma, you are doing karma and the return will surely come.
- Mahatma Gandhi gave three monkeys [...] Don't speak bad, don't hear bad, don't see bad, but at the same time don't think bad.
- Whatever you think is also an action, it's a part of karma.

### Is god always watching? @9:51
- No [...] you are watching yourself, yes, the subconscious is always watching you.
- So whatever return you are giving it it is you yourself returning yourself.
- Actually you chose the parents, it's your karmic account, the kind of sister, brother, the wife, the kids, everything is all karmic connection, you chose it.
- Your subconscious is recording everything, so you are watching yourself.
- Be aware of your conscious, because you are watching yourself.

### Corona: Whatever is happening now, is it because of the karma? @10:38
- Of course yes, the answer is yes.
- The planet belongs to all animals equally.
- Just because human has mind, human has a brain and he is able to produce and create things he becomes superior or he treat himself superior and the rest of the animals are not taken care and that is the outcome what we are facing now.
- At present also millions of people are consuming nonveg and it started because of that.
- Why can't we shift to plant based food? Why can't we have a good plant based diet? And it is equally nourishing and it comes with positive energy.

### How to now balance it? What can we do? @11:56
- Suppose you throw a stone outside. The stone will always come back to you. It can come any back like if you throw it outside and immediately it can come or it can come after few years or it can come after many years back. Or in next birth. But the stone will come back. 
- So you can not stop the outer action [...] but you can stay balanced and calm.
- You remain positive and always radiate just positive energy.
- Whatever negative is happening, embrace it and accept it and just you radiate positive energy.
- Gradually a time will come when you are at complete inner bliss because all your karmic account is clear and you are at inner bliss.
